# What is it?

It's a tiny Operating System for RISC-V using the Zig language that I've decided to work on during the July holidays to learn more about OSes on practice after taking the OS class on my university.

I'm initially following the [Operating System in 1,000 Lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/) guide. After that, if I still have time before classes start, build more on top of it.

# Why RISC-V?

I've chosen RISC-V because that's the architecture I'm most familiarized from the classes I've taken. After looking for resources to build the OS for this architecture I've found the above guide, which is just perfect for me.

# Why Zig?

I believe Zig can be a great candidate for programming Linux in the future, given that it's easy to transition to from a C background, it has a big emphasis on compile time operations, it's easy to do unsafe operations and, finally, it has awesome multiplatform build system.

I've already had projects I've worked on with Zig, so I'm familiar with the language. But the build system is not very clear to me yet, so I'll use this opportunity to learn it as well.

Note: I have not finished the project, and have also not finished the transition to the Zig language. It's all scattered in the branches lol. Someday I might come back and redo it all
